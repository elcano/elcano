<H1>Elcano Design</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Vehicles</H2>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>An Elcano vehicle is a tadpole tricycle. The powered
rear wheel does not need a differential. Ackerrman steering is used
on the front wheels. All software should be usable with varying
values for vehicle weight and geometry. The typical electrathon
vehicle fits into the Elcano class. An Elcano vehicle must be
electrically powered, but there is no restriction on battery
chemistry, voltage or weight. If an Elcano vehicle carries a
passenger, that person is not allowed to exercise any control other
than activating the emergency stop. Note that current (2010) SRS
Robo-Magellan (<A HREF="http://www.robothon.org/robothon/robo-magellan.php">http://www.robothon.org/robothon/robo-magellan.php</A>
) rules restrict vehicle loaded weight to 50 pounds (23 kg) and
require that the vehicle fit within a cube 4 feet (1.1 m) on an edge.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>There are separate power sources for motor power and
electronics power. Applying the E-stop removes all motor power. Any
system relying on a powered motor must go to a safe state when there
is no power.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Elcano #1 is located in Seattle, Washington, USA. The
chassis is a Catrike Dash (<A HREF="http://www.catrike.com/catrike_dash.html">http://www.catrike.com/catrike_dash.html</A>)
with mast, pedals, seat, chain, derailleur, etc removed. The rear
wheel has been replaced by a Pedalgreen 16&rdquo; wheel with hub
motor. (<A HREF="http://pedalgreen.net/">http://pedalgreen.net/</A> )
We expect to use Li-ion batteries, but are currently experimenting
with lead-acid batteries. The vehicle meets Robo-Magellan size and
weight limits.</FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Computer Hardware</H2>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Computation is performed on micro-controllers
organized in a subsumption architecture. Classic subsumption
architecture is based on behaviors implemented on distributed
micro-controllers, each of which reads information from a sensor and
sends its reaction to an actuator. The preferred micro-controller is
the Arduino (<A HREF="http://www.arduino.cc/">http://www.arduino.cc/</A>
). Code is written in C or C++. All systems must be designed to fail
in a safe state.</FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">System Architecture</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western">Actuators</H3>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>A1: Drive Motor</B>. Controls motor on rear
wheel.<BR>Input: Signal from motor controller (C1)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>A2: Brake Motor</B>. Brake Motor. Controls disk
brakes on left and right front wheels. Brakes are mechanically linked
to operate in tandem. Brakes are normally ON; an active signal is
required to release them.<BR>Input: Signal from motor controller (C1)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>A3: Steering Motor</B>. Turns left or right. If no
signal, wheels are locked to a straight ahead position.<BR>Input:
Signal from steering controller (C2)</FONT></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Sensors</H3>
<P>Most sensors go to the Navigator module (C6).<FONT FACE="SimSun"><SPAN LANG="zh-CN"><FONT FACE="SimSun"><FONT SIZE=2><SPAN LANG="en">&#12288;</SPAN></FONT></FONT></SPAN></FONT>Sensor
output may be mediated by a dedicated controller before being sent to
the Navigator. Some sensors (e.g. S5, S6) are virtual.</P>
<P>S1: Wheel Odometry. A magnetic pickup sends a signal for each
revolution of the wheel. If finer resolution is required, there may
be several magnets on the rim. Goes to C1.</P>
<P>S2: Angle of front wheels. Goes to C2.</P>
<P>S3: Digital Compass.</P>
<P>S4: Coyote Robotics stereo camera. This purchased module contains
cameras and a micro-controller. The sensor reduces the video stream
to a few useful items, which include visual odometry, lane following
and obstacle avoidance. The information is further interpreted by the
Obstacle Avoidance controller (C5).</P>
<P>S5: Commanded and planned speeds from motor controller (C1).</P>
<P>S6: Commanded and planned steering angles from Steering Controller
(C2).</P>
<P>S7: GPS. GPS is not accurate enough to be the primary position
indicator. GPS will sometimes be unavailable. The navigation system
must be designed to function for extended periods of GPS
unavailability.</P>
<P>S8: Landmark recognition camera. Certain landmarks may be provided
to aid navigation. It is not clear whether the Coyote Robotics camera
can recognize them.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Input Files</H3>
<P>RNDF (Route Network Definition File). Format is defined on . This
is a digital map of all roads in the area where the vehicle will be
operating. The camera will locate road edges or lane markers and the
vehicle will follow them. Thus location can be determined primarily
from odometry.</P>
<P>MDF (Mission Definition File). These are latitudes and longitudes
that the vehicle is required to visit.</P>
<P>Initial position. Specifies the starting location and orientation.
Velocity is zero.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Controller Modules</H3>
<P>Each module conceptually runs on its own micro-controller.
Implementation may combine one or more modules on the same
micro-controller. There is no operating system, file system or disks.
Modules may communicate with a host computer for software download.</P>
<P>C1: Motor Controller.<BR>Outputs: to A1 (Drive motor), A2 (Brake
motor) and S5 (Commanded speeds).<BR>Input: Gamebot command from C3
(Pilot).</P>
<P>C2: Steering Controller.<BR>Outputs to A3 (Steering motor) and S6
(Commanded steering).<BR>Input: Gamebot command from C3 (Pilot).</P>
<P>C3: Pilot.<BR>Output: to C1, C2: Gamebot commands.<BR>Input from
C4: Desired route as Bezier or Hermite cubic curve segments.<BR>Input
from C4: Desired speed profile.<BR>Input from C5: Speed and course
modifications.</P>
<P>C4: Path Planner. Since this module reads files from a memory
stick, it may use a local operating system.<BR>Output to C3: Desired
route and speed curves and whether it exits a road or changes
lane.<BR>Input: RNDF, MDF and initial position files from memory
stick.<BR>Input from C6: Position, orientation, velocity and
acceleration.</P>
<P>C5: Obstacle Avoidance. Also passes visual odometry and lane
following information from S4.<BR>Output to C3: Course and speed
corrections for obstacle avoidance.<BR>Output to C3: Course
corrections for lane following.<BR>Output to C6: Visual
Odometry.<BR>Input: text information extracted from camera via sensor
module S4.</P>
<P>C6: Navigator. Fuses all position estimates with dead
reckoning.<BR>Output to C4: Location, orientation, velocity and
acceleration.<BR>Inputs from S1, S2, S3, C5 (visual odometry), S5,
S6, S7 and S8.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Behaviors</H3>
<P>B1: Move.  Travel at a commanded speed as long as a signal is
present. When the signal is not present, apply regenerative braking.
Speed should include reverse.<BR>Executes on C1 to control A1 with
feedback from S1.</P>
<P>B2: Brake.  Use brake to stop when forward signal is not present.
Use brake to slow when desired speed has decreased.<BR>Executes on C1
to control A2 with feedback from S1.</P>
<P>B3: Steer. Turn front wheels as commanded by signal. No signal
means straight ahead.<BR>Executes on C2 to control A3 with feedback
from S2.</P>
<P>B4: Speed Profile. Move to follow a trapezoid specifying when to
accelerate and decelerate.<BR>Executes on C3 with output to C1.<BR><BR>B5:
Route curve.  Follow a cubic curved path, synchronizing with the
speed profile.<BR>Executes on C3 with output to C2.</P>
<P>B6: File reading. Read and parse files giving initial position,
MDF and RNDF.<BR>Executes on C4.</P>
<P>B7: Bee line. Given current position, velocity, orientation and
target position with desired orientation and velocity at terminus,
produce a cubic curved path and speed profile and follow it.<BR>Executes
on C4 with output to C3. 
</P>
<P>B8: Extract camera data. Break out Visual Odometry (S4A), Lane
Following (S4B), Obstacle Avoidance (S4C) and Waypoint Recognition
(S4D). <BR>Executes on C5 with input from S4.</P>
<P>B9: Waypoint approach. See a waypoint and steer toward it if it is
the target.  Recognize when waypoint is reached. Reverse if needed
and set goal as next waypoint.<BR>Executes on C4 with input from S4A
and output to C3.</P>
<P>B10: Location. Compute position, speed and acceleration. Numbers
are fuzzy quantities that include an error margin.<BR>Executes on C6
with output to C4.<BR>B10A: Straight line dead reckoning. From the
last known position, velocity and elapsed time, compute present
position. Uses S5 (commanded speed).<BR>B10B: Curved dead reckoning.
Incorporate turning information from S6 (commanded course).<BR>B10C:
Orientation. Add S3 (digital compass).<BR>B10D: Map reading. Add
intended position on RNDF.<BR>B10E: Excursions.  Correct the position
to account for course deviations to avoid obstacles.<BR>B10F: GPS. 
Use S7.<BR>B10G: Landmarks. Narrow position error spreads by
recognizing fixed points with S8.</P>
<P>B11: Lane following. Keep in the lane or road unless if a change
has been commanded.<BR>Executes on C5 with input from S4B and output
to C3.<BR><BR>B12: Obstacle avoidance. Compute a speed and course to
move around obstacles.<BR>Executes on C5 with input from S4C and
output to C3.</P>
<P>B13: Follow plan. Devise a path on the road to next
waypoint.<BR>Executes on C4 with input from C6, MDF, and RNDF.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Simulator</H2>
<P>USARSIM (<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/usarsim/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/usarsim/</A>
) using ARDA map. A RNDF and MDF for ARDA are available. The
simulator is open source other than requiring the Unreal Tournament
game.</P>
<P>The simulated control system includes C3, C4, C5, C6 and S4. The
S4 camera may be pointed at the graphic simulation. The gamebot
output from C3 is compatible with the simulator. Simulated input
replaces S1, S2, S3, S5, S6 and S7.</P>
<P>Control modules may be executed on their micro-controllers.
Alternately, all or part of the control code may be executed on a
PC.<BR><BR><BR>
