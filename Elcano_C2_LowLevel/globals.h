/*
 * C2 is the low-level controller that sends control signals to the hub motor,
 * brake servo, and steering servo.  It is (or will be) a PID controller, but
 * may also impose limits on control values for the motor and servos as a safety
 * measure to protect against incorrect PID settings.
 *
 * It receives desired speed and heading from either of two sources, an RC
 * controller operated by a person, or the C3 pilot module.  These are mutually
 * exclusive.
 *
 * RC commands are received directly as interrupts on a bank of pins.  C3 commands
 * are received over a serial line using the Elcano Serial protocol.  Heading and
 * speed commands do not need to be passed through to other modules, but because
 * the Elcano Serial protocol uses a unidirectional ring structure, C2 may need to
 * pass through *other* commands that come from C3 but are intended for modules
 * past C2 on the ring.
