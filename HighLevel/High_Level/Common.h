  We represent points as locations in mm. A 32 bit signed long is good for +/- 2000 km.
  Latitudes and longitudes are given as a double with up to 9 digits,

  On the Arduino, a float is the same as a double, giving 6 to 7 decimal digits.
  This means that mm resolution only applies within 1 km of the origin.
