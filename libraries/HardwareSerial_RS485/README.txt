Arduino RS485 communication software

by Michael Jonker


This project provides a software suite to support the use of an RS485 transceiver connected to the USART (Tx/Rx pins)
in a half-duplex, concurrent multi-drop (i.e. multi-master, multi-slave) environment. For this purpose, the software
suite provides capabilities for message addressing and filtering as well as collision detection and collision avoidance.
