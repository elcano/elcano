Arduino RS485 communication software

by Michael Jonker

This file gives the installation instructions of HardwareSerialRS485.

For detailed instructions see: https://github.com/MichaelJonker/HardwareSerialRS485/wiki/installation-and-deployment

To use the HardwareSerialRS485 library you have to specify to which ports the TE and RE* enable lines the RS485 interface transceiver is connected.
For convenience, you are advised to define your RS485 specific boards using the following instructions:

a) Create the following folder structure under your Arduino Project Folder <APF>:
   <APF>/hardware/HardwareSerialRS485/avr
   where <APF> is your existing Arduino project folder, i.e. the folder under which all your sketches are
   residing as well as the libraries folder with the user installed libraries.

b) Copy the following files to <APF>/hardware/HardwareSerialRS485/avr
   <APF>/libraries/HardwareSerialRS485/extras/boards.txt
   <APF>/libraries/HardwareSerialRS485/extras/DisableHardwareSerial.h
   These files are distributed together with this library.
   
c) Edit the file boards.txt to configure your board specific parameters for the RS485 WE and RE* connections, through
   the definitions "-DRS485configuration_TRxControl=TRxControl< 'B', 7, 6 >" in the extra_flags values.
   Detailed instructions are given in the boards.txt file and on the project wiki pages.
