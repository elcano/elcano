<H1>Elcano Manual Control 
</H1>
<P>Elcano is meant to run autonomously and there was originally
minimal user input. 
</P>
<P>It has since been redesigned as a dual mode vehicle. Computer
control of the motor, brakes and steering is now referred to as
&ldquo;cruise control&rdquo; and can be set by the rider.  The rider
can also control the vehicle by a joystick.  In addition to the
wireless commands listed below, there are physical switches on the
vehicle that do the same functions. The vehicle can run without
anyone on-board.</P>
<P>The following controls are available on a remote control unit.
This unit may be connected to the vehicle by a USB port during the
initialization phase. At other times, the control unit is in radio
contact with the vehicle.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Initialization</H2>
<P>The user may enter a latitude and longitude for the start
position. The initial bearing may also be entered. The robot is
designed to operate in places where GPS or compass are unavailable.</P>
<P>On start-up, the C4 Path Planner has access to several Route
Network Definition Files (RNDF) and Mission Definition Files (MDF).
The RNDF is a digital roadmap that gives the preferred routes
connecting points. The MDF files contain a sequence of waypoints to
be visited in the present mission. The user has the option of
specifying the MDF and RNDF file.</P>
<P>For testing purposes, the number of a behavior may be specified
instead of an MDF.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Go</H2>
<P>Begin motion according to the selected program.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Halt</H2>
<P>The Halt switch instructs the C1 computer to pause the vehicle
until the switch is released. The Halt switch also goes to the C4
Path Planner and causes it to not instruct any more motion until the
switch is released.</P>
<P>The Halt switch is an interrupt to the C1 computer. When it is
asserted, the vehicle will remove the throttle, apply recombinant
braking and apply the disk brakes. When Halt is removed, the computer
resumes its prior operation.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Reset</H2>
<P>The Reset button is wired to the reset pin on all
micro-controllers, with the exception of the C1 motor controller. It
thus causes all other micro-controllers to reinitialize themselves to
the start state. Reset causes a Halt signal to be sent to the C1
controller, which brings the vehicle to a stop. The C3 computer
initialization pauses for enough time for the vehicle to stop. Only
then does C3 send a Reset signal to the C1 computer.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Emergency Stop</H2>
<P>The E-stop must bring the vehicle to a complete stop without
relying on any of the computers. Thus applying the E-stop breaks the
circuit by which the traction battery powers the hub motor, motor
controller, brake motor and steering motor. Without power to the
actuators, the computer is unable to stop or control the vehicle.
Thus recombinant braking is not possible when E-stop is pushed. When
traction power is lost, there is no acceleration of the hub motor.
Without power, the brakes are spring activated and are applied.</P>
<P>The E-stop should only be applied when the Halt signal does not
respond.</P>
