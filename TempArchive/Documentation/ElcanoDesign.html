<H1>Elcano Design</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Vehicles</H2>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>An Elcano vehicle is a tadpole tricycle. The powered
rear wheel does not need a differential. Ackerrman steering is used
on the front wheels. All software should be usable with varying
values for vehicle weight and geometry. The typical electrathon
vehicle fits into the Elcano class. An Elcano vehicle must be
electrically powered, but there is no restriction on battery
chemistry, voltage or weight. If an Elcano vehicle carries a
passenger, that person is not allowed to exercise any control other
than activating the emergency stop. Note that current (2011) SRS
Robo-Magellan (<A HREF="http://www.robothon.org/robothon/robo-magellan.php">http://www.robothon.org/robothon/robo-magellan.php</A>
) rules restrict vehicle loaded weight to 50 pounds (23 kg) and
require that the vehicle fit within a cube 4 feet (1.1 m) on an edge.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>There are separate power sources for traction motor
power and electronics power. Applying the E-stop may remove traction
motor power. Any system relying on a powered motor must go to a safe
state when there is no power.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Elcano #1 is located in Seattle, Washington, USA. The
chassis is a Catrike Dash (<A HREF="http://www.catrike.com/catrike_dash.html">http://www.catrike.com/catrike_dash.html</A>)
with mast, pedals, seat, chain, derailleur, etc removed. The rear
wheel has been replaced by a Pedalgreen 16&rdquo; wheel with hub
motor. (<A HREF="http://pedalgreen.net/">http://pedalgreen.net/</A> )
We use Li-ion batteries. The vehicle meets Robo-Magellan size and
weight limits.</FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Computer Hardware</H2>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Computation is performed on micro-controllers
organized in a modified subsumption architecture. Classic subsumption
architecture is based on behaviors implemented on distributed
micro-controllers, each of which reads information from a sensor and
sends its reaction to an actuator. The preferred micro-controller is
the Arduino (<A HREF="http://www.arduino.cc/">http://www.arduino.cc/</A>
). Code is written in C or C++. All systems must be designed to fail
in a safe state.</FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">System Architecture</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western">Actuators</H3>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>A1: Traction (Drive) Motor</B>. Controls motor on
rear wheel.<BR>Input: Signal from motor controller (C1)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>A2: Brake Motor</B>. Brake Motor. Controls disk
brakes on left and right front wheels. Brakes are mechanically linked
to operate in tandem. Brakes are normally ON; an active signal is
required to release them.<BR>Input: Signal from motor controller (C1)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>A3: Steering Motor</B>. Turns left or right. If no
signal, wheels are locked to a straight ahead position.<BR>Input:
Signal from motor controller (C1)</FONT></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Sensors</H3>
<P>Most sensors go to the Navigator module (C6).<FONT FACE="SimSun"><SPAN LANG="zh-CN"><FONT FACE="SimSun"><FONT SIZE=2><SPAN LANG="en">&#12288;</SPAN></FONT></FONT></SPAN></FONT>Sensor
output may be mediated by a dedicated controller before being sent to
the Navigator. Some sensors (e.g. S5) are virtual.</P>
<P>S1: Wheel Odometry. A magnetic pickup sends a signal for each
revolution of the wheel. If finer resolution is required, there may
be several magnets on the rim. Goes to C1, C6.</P>
<P>S2: Angle of front wheels. Goes to C1.</P>
<P>S3: Digital Compass.</P>
<P>S4: Smart stereo camera. This purchased module contains cameras
and a micro-controller. The sensor reduces the video stream to a few
useful items, which include visual odometry, lane following and
obstacle avoidance. The information is further interpreted by the
Visual Data Management controller (C7).</P>
<P>S5: Commanded and planned speeds and steering angles from Pilot
(C3).</P>
<P>S7: GPS. GPS is not accurate enough to be the primary position
indicator. GPS will sometimes be unavailable. The navigation system
must be designed to function for extended periods of GPS
unavailability.</P>
<P>S8: Landmark recognition. Certain landmarks may be provided to aid
navigation. This function may be provided by the Smart Camera (S4) or
may be a separate camera.</P>
<P>S9: IMU Inertial Measurement (or Navigation) Unit.</P>
<P>S10: Brake feedback. May measure the tension on the brake cable.</P>
<P>S11: Proximity sensors</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Input Files</H3>
<P>RNDF (Route Network Definition File). Format is defined on . This
is a digital map of all roads in the area where the vehicle will be
operating. The camera will locate road edges or lane markers and the
vehicle will follow them. Thus location can be determined primarily
from odometry.</P>
<P>MDF (Mission Definition File). These are latitudes and longitudes
that the vehicle is required to visit.</P>
<P>Initial position. Specifies the starting location and orientation.
Velocity is zero. If this is a file, it is read by C4 (Path Planner)
and passed to C6 (Navigator). If it is user input, it is read by C6
(Navigator).</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Controller Modules</H3>
<P>Each module conceptually runs on its own micro-controller.
Implementation may combine one or more modules on the same
micro-controller. There is no operating system, file system or disks.
Modules may communicate with a host computer for software download.</P>

position estimates with dead reckoning.<BR>Output to C3, C4:
Location, orientation, velocity and acceleration.<BR>Inputs from S1,
S2, S3, C5 (visual odometry), S5, S6, S7 and S8.</P>
<P>C7: Visual Data Management. Passes visual odometry and lane
following information from S4.<BR>Input: text information extracted
from camera via sensor module S4.<BR>Output to C6: Deviation from
lane following.<BR>Output to C6: Visual Odometry.<BR>Output to C5:
Speeds and locations of obstacles.<BR><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Behaviors</H3>
<P>B1: Move. Travel at a commanded speed as long as a signal is
present. When the signal is not present, apply regenerative braking.
Speed should include reverse.<BR>Executes on C1 to control A1 with
feedback from S1.</P>
<P>B2: Brake. Use brake to stop when forward signal is not present.
Use brake to slow when desired speed has decreased.<BR>Executes on C1
to control A2 with feedback from S1 and S10.</P>
<P>B3: Steer. Turn front wheels as commanded by signal. No signal
means straight ahead.<BR>Executes on C1 to control A3 with feedback
from S2.</P>
<P>B4: Speed Profile. Move to follow a trapezoid specifying when to
accelerate and decelerate.<BR>Executes on C3 with output to C1.<BR><BR>B5:
Route curve. Follow a cubic curved path, synchronizing with the speed
profile.<BR>Executes on C3 with output to C2.</P>
<P>B6: File reading. Read and parse files giving initial position,
MDF and RNDF.<BR>Executes on C4.</P>
<P>B7: Bee line. Given current position, velocity, orientation and
target position with desired orientation and velocity at terminus,
produce a cubic curved path and speed profile and follow it.<BR>Executes
on C4 with output to C3. 
</P>
<P>B8: Extract camera data. Break out Visual Odometry (S4A), Lane
Following (S4B), Obstacle Avoidance (S4C) and Waypoint Recognition
(S4D). <BR>Executes on C7 with input from S4.</P>

the target. Recognize when waypoint is reached. Reverse if needed and
set goal as next waypoint.<BR>Executes on C4 with input from S4A and
output to C3.</P>
<P>B10: Location. Compute position, speed and acceleration. Numbers
are fuzzy quantities that include an error margin.<BR>Executes on C6
with output to C4.<BR>B10A: Straight line dead reckoning. From the
last known position, velocity and elapsed time, compute present
position. Uses S5 (commanded speed).<BR>B10B: Curved dead reckoning.
Incorporate turning information from S5 (commanded course).<BR>B10C:
Orientation. Add S3 (digital compass).<BR>B10D: Map reading. Add
intended position on RNDF.<BR>B10E: Excursions. Correct the position
to account for course deviations to avoid obstacles.<BR>B10F: GPS.
Use S7.<BR>B10G: Landmarks. Narrow position error spreads by
recognizing fixed points with S8.</P>
<P>B11: Lane following. Keep in the lane or road unless if a change
has been commanded.<BR>Executes on C7 and C6 with input from S4B and
output to C3.<BR><BR>B12: Obstacle avoidance. Compute a speed and

<H2 CLASS="western">Simulator</H2>
<P>USARSIM (<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/usarsim/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/usarsim/</A>
) using ARDA map. A RNDF and MDF for ARDA are available. The
simulator is open source other than requiring the Unreal Tournament
game.</P>
<P>The simulated control system includes C3, C4, C5, C6, C7 and S4.
The S4 camera may be pointed at the graphic simulation. The gamebot
output from C3 is compatible with the simulator. Simulated input
replaces S1, S2, S3, S5, S7, S8, S9, S10 and S11.</P>
<P>Control modules may be executed on their micro-controllers.
Alternately, all or part of the control code may be executed on a
PC.<BR><BR><BR>
