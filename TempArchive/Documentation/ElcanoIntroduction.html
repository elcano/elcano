<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Use open source code and
	standardized hardware design
	(<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/urbanchallenge/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/urbanchallenge/</A>)
	to routinely build vehicles capable of running Robo-Magellan
	(<A HREF="http://www.robothon.org/robothon/robo-magellan.php">http://www.robothon.org/robothon/robo-magellan.php</A>)
	at speeds of 20-30 mph (35-50 kph).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When several such vehicles have
	been built, demonstrate communication and control systems capable of
	operating the vehicles as a personal rapid transit (PRT).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Start a commercial company to
	build high quality urban transportation systems based on the
	hobbyist proof-of-concept.

<H2 CLASS="western">About the name</H2>
<P>Magellan did not sail around the world, since he died in the
Philippines. The first people to circumnavigate the globe were 18
members of Magellan's crew, under the leadership of Juan Sebastian
Elcano (<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Sebasti&aacute;n_Elcano">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Sebasti&aacute;n_Elcano</A>).</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The DARPA Grand Challenge
(<A HREF="http://www.darpa.mil/grandchallenge">http://www.darpa.mil/grandchallenge</A>)
races for autonomous vehicles have demonstrated feasibility. Autonomy
has enormous implications and it becomes much easier when the
infrastructure helps the vehicles. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Vehicles can operate with shorter
	following distances, which increase the capacity of freeway lanes by
	a factor of four.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Based on comparing accident rates
	of autonomous commuter trains with motor vehicles, we can expect
	safety to improve by a factor of 30. Motor vehicles kill 40,000
	people annually in the US at an economic cost of $231 billion
	(<A HREF="http://www.bts.gov/publications/transportation_statistics_annual_report/2004/html/chapter_02/economic_costs_of_motor_vehicle_crashes.html">http://www.bts.gov/publications/transportation_statistics_annual_report/2004/html/chapter_02/economic_costs_of_motor_vehicle_crashes.html</A>).
		</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An SUV no longer has a safety
	advantage over a motorcycle.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The average American car weighs
	4000 pounds (1800 kg) while the average American male weighs 190 lb
	(86 kg). Since energy to overcome rolling resistance is proportional
	to mass, that energy requirement falls by a factor of 10 for a 200
	lb (90 kg) vehicle.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Autonomous vehicles can be
	operated as a railless personal rapid transit (PRT) system. Since
	there are no intermediate stops, a 30 mph (50 kph) PRT system is as
	fast as a 60mph (100 kph) light rail system.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The energy needed for stops and
	starts is mostly eliminated.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At 30 mph (50 kph), energy to
	overcome aerodynamic drag is 8 times less than at 60 mph (100 kph).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Light autonomous electric vehicles
	can be expected to achieve 1000 mpg (0.25 l/100 km) equivalent.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">US drivers go 3 trillion vehicle
	miles every year, with 65% classified as urban. If half the urban
	miles were replaced with light vehicles, the US would use 1.5
	million fewer barrels of oil daily.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the best case, vehicle
	electricity is produced without fossil fuels. In the worst case of
	producing energy from coal, US carbon savings are 160,000 tons
	(146,000 metric tons) per day. This is 12 trains each pulling 100
	coal cars.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Electrathons have demonstrated
	that students and hobbyists can build electric vehicles capable of
	covering 40 miles (70 km) in an hour.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">DARPA Grand Challenge vehicles
	used navigation instruments priced above $10,000. In a non-hostile
	environment, autonomy can be done for about $1000.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An autonomous public/private light
	vehicle system gives the performance of light rail at a much lower
	cost. It allows people to operate their vehicles manually on city
	streets.</P>
