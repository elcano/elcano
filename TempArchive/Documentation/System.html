<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Elcano Project is
developing low-cost hardware and software kits to convert any vehicle
to self-drive. We are concentrating on recumbent tricycles, since
that produces a real people mover at a total cost of under $5000. Our
kits could also be used in full-sized cars or toy RC cars.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The kits are based on
Arduino microcontrollers, and allow you to connect them robustly into
a compact, low power package. The basic package uses several
processors:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">C2 – Dual
	control: low level vehicle control, either from the driver or the
	AI.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">C3 – Pilot:
	Detects obstacles and feeds settings for the next path segment to
	C2.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">C4 – Path
	Planner: Computes the best route from current location to
	destination.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">C5 – Reverse
	pilot (optional): May supplement C3 and C6.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">C6 – Navigator:
	Reads GPS, INU, Odometer, Sonars, etc. to get best position
	estimate.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">C7 – Vision:
	Locates certain features of interest.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">C8 – Simulator
	interface: Replaces sensor inputs with outputs of PC simulator.</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Processing is supported
by a set of custom circuit boards:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">MegaShieldDB –
	Plugs into C2 and brings out signals on robust cables, making the
	wheels spin and steer.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">MegaShieldTrio –
	Houses C3, C4, C6, INU and GPS. It can also be configured to include
	C5. 
	</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sonar – Houses
	five sonar range finders, covering 180 degrees.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">MegaShieldSim –
	Houses C8 and connects to the MegaShieldTrio.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Panel – Operator
	status information and switches.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">E-stop – Remote
	E-stop and joystick for operator control.</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The heart of the system
is the flexible MegaShieldTrio board. It includes a proto-board area
and may be useful for any project based on three or four Arduinos.
The standard configuration uses an Arduino Mega SDK for C6, and
Arduino Nanos for C4 and C3. The Mega SDK is a USB host and will
interface to an Android smart phone. Shields can be plugged into C6
and C4. The MegaShieldTrio has plugs for odometers and two sonar
boards. Alternatively, the board accepts a Digilent Max 32 as C6. It
can also be built to use an Arduino Uno for C6 and and an Arduino
Nano for C5. The main communications link between processors is
serial.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The C7 vision processor
may be any suitable platform, and communicates with C6 over USB. It
will also use USB to talk to a camera. The C7 processor could be
quite extensive, and incorporate V2V, I2V, radar and Lidar.  The
system will work without any C7 processor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A PC based simulator is
under development. It will use USB to communicate with C8; C8 then
generates all the sensor signals for the AI. These include a
simulated video camera to C7. It also supplies the signals that would
come from GPS, INU, Odometry and Sonars.
