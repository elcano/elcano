This project provides a software suite to support the use of an RS485 transceiver connected to the USART (Tx/Rx pins) in a half-duplex, concurrent multi-drop (i.e. multi-master, multi-slave) environment. For this purpose, the software suite provides capabilities for message addressing and filtering as well as collision detection and collision avoidance.
